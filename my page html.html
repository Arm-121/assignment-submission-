    <h1> Think Positive </h1>
     <pre>
            Positive thoughts can let you focus on the brighter side of life.
            A positive person can enjoy happiness and success since he believes that 
            he can easily overcome all the obstacles and difficulties that come his way.
            Not all people generally agree with positive thinking. In fact, some people consider it a nonsense.
            However, there are a number of people who believe in its effectiveness. 
            If you want to use this in your life then you must practice the attitude of positive thinking in everything that you do.
